# IndieLand
🍺 Indie-Land is a gorgeous place to discover Taiwan Indie Music activities immediately by just browsing our website. 

## Cache Benchmarks
We gain 10 times performance using reversed caching!

```bash=
$ time curl localhost:9292/api/v1/events/
```
    real    0m0.358s
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.016s

run it again

```bash=
$ time curl localhost:9292/api/v1/events/
```
    real    0m0.034s
    user    0m0.016s
    sys     0m0.016s

## Our goals
- Show recent indie music events sorted by date.
- Group events by the country; Therefore, people can select events by the place.

## Long-term goals
- Display events on the map so people can see nearby events.
- Users can leave comments on the events.
- Users can "like" the event and we will show the number of likes.

## Our Api
- /api/v1/events
    - /api/v1/events/{id}
    - /api/v1/events/{id}/sessions
        - /api/v1/events/{event_id}/sessions/{session}

## Database Design
- We have two tables.
    - Event table
        | id | event_name | website | created_at | updated_at |
        |:--:|:----------:|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|
        | 45 | 「手遊傳藝」聽障導覽活動報名 | https://event.culture.tw/NCFTA | 2020-11-08 11:24:27 +0800 | 2020-11-08 11:24:27 +0800 |

    - Session table
        | id | event_id | start_time | end_time | address | place | created_at | updated_at |
        |:--:|:--------:|:----------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----:|:----------:|:----------:|
        | 57 | 45 | 2020/07/06 13:00:00 | 2020/07/06 13:00:00 | 268  宜蘭縣五結鄉五濱路二段201號 | | 2020-11-08 11:25:46.641456 +0800 | 2020-11-08 11:25:46.641456 +0800 |

- Relation
    - An event has one or more than one session.
        - The Session is a weak entity because it must depend on the Event.

## Usage
### Installation
If you don't have [Ruby] (2.7.1) please download.

Step1. Clone the [Indie-Land].
```bash=
$ git clone https://github.com/Lobarbon/Indie-Land.git
$ cd Indie-Land
```

```

Step3. Install ``Gemfile`` package.

### Running the Application
Running a Roda application is similar to running any other rack-based application that uses a ``config.ru`` file. You can start a basic server using ``rackup``:
```bash=
$ rackup
```
or
```bash=
$ rake up
```
Ruby web servers such as Unicorn and Puma also ship with their own programs that you can use to run a Roda application.

By default, the base URL we're targeting is [http://localhost:9292].

### Rakefile

    - Run app.
        ```bash=
        $ rake up

        $ rake rerack
        ```
